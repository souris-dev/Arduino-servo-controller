{"name":"Arduino Servo Controller","tagline":"Software to control the servos attached to the PWM pins of an Arduino Mega and Uno.","body":"Arduino Servo Controller\r\n===================\r\n-------------------------------\r\n\r\nAbout this Project\r\n-------\r\n\r\nArduino servo controller is a Windows Form Application that is programmed in C#.NET. \r\nIt is used to control the servos that are connected to the PWM pins on an Arduino Mega or Uno.\r\nIt uses serial communitcation to communicate with the Arduino on a specified COM port.\r\nIn case of Mega, there are 13 PWM pins, and 3 or 4 PWM pins on an Arduino Uno, hence there are two versions (one of them coming soon) Uno, and Mega.\r\n\r\nThis application can find its usage in controlling servo-controlled robots, like humanoids.\r\n\r\nGetting Started\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\n**Note**: The software has not been thoroughly tested yet. **Use at your own risk.**\r\n\r\n1. Download the ZIP file, or checkout/clone the repo.\r\n2. Open the Solution in you Visual Studio IDE (best to use 2012, express will work).\r\n3. Build the whole solution.\r\n4. Upload the sketch \"RemoteCont.ino\" onto the Arduino Mega/Uno using the Arduino IDE.\r\n5. Note the serial COM port on which the Arduino is present.\r\n6. Use the application.\r\n \r\nVersion Information\r\n---------------------\r\n**v1:**\r\n* Provides basic servo control (only using Mega).\r\n\r\n**v2:**\r\n* Fixed resize issue\r\n* Improved the user interface\r\n* More fixes have been made\r\n* Improved servo control (in code)\r\n\r\n**v3 (coming soon):**\r\n* Actions and frames will be added\r\n* User will be able to save the actions in a file\r\n\r\nContact Information\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nContact e-mail of author:\r\n[suorees113@gmail.com](mailto:suorees113@gmail.com)\r\n\r\nSuggestions, contributions and opinions are always welcome.\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nSee *LICENSE* file.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
