{"name":"Arduino Servo Controller","tagline":"Software to control the servos attached to the PWM pins of an Arduino Mega and Uno.","body":"Arduino Servo Controller\r\n===================\r\n-------------------------------\r\n\r\nAbout this Project\r\n-------\r\n\r\nArduino servo controller is a Windows Form Application that is programmed in C#.NET. \r\nIt is used to control the servos that are connected to the PWM pins on an Arduino Mega or Uno.\r\nIt uses serial communitcation to communicate with the Arduino on a specified COM port.\r\nIn case of Mega, there are 13 PWM pins, and 3 or 4 PWM pins on an Arduino Uno, hence there are two versions (one of them coming soon) Uno, and Mega.\r\n\r\nThis application can find its usage in controlling servo-controlled robots, like humanoids.\r\n\r\nGetting Started\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\n**Note**: The software has not been thoroughly tested yet. **Use at your own risk.**\r\n\r\n1. Download the ZIP file, or checkout/clone the repo and then extract it.\r\n2. Open the Solution in you Visual Studio IDE (best to use 2012, others may/may not work, express will).\r\n3. Build the whole solution.\r\n4. Upload the sketch \"RemoteCont.ino\" onto the Arduino Mega/Uno using the Arduino IDE.\r\n5. Note the serial COM port on which the Arduino is present.\r\n6. Use the application.\r\n \r\nVersion Information\r\n---------------------\r\n**v1:**\r\n* Provides basic servo control (only using Mega).\r\n\r\n**v2:**\r\n* Fixed resize issue\r\n* Improved the user interface\r\n* More fixes have been made\r\n* Improved servo control (in code)\r\n\r\n**v3 (coming soon):**\r\n* Actions and frames will be added\r\n* User will be able to save the actions in a file\r\n\r\nContact Information\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nContact e-mail of author:\r\n[suorees113@gmail.com](mailto:suorees113@gmail.com)\r\n\r\nSuggestions, contributions and opinions are always welcome.\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nThe MIT License (MIT)\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2014 souris-dev\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\r\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
